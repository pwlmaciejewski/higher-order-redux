Higher-order Redux
-----

Higher-order Redux is a utility belt for Redux that makes
heavy use of **higher-order reducers** to provide:

ðŸ”© Reduced boilerplate  
ðŸ“¦ Increased modularity  
ðŸš„ Development speedup

Oh, btw... Higher-order reducer is a function that takes a reducer argument and returns a new reducer:

```typescript
HigherOrderReducer<State, Action> = (innerReducer: Reducer<State, Action>): Reducer<State, Action>
```

## Installation

```
yarn add higher-order-redux
```


## Quick start

Here's a standard reducer that we all know an love:

```typescript
export default function reducer (state = initialState, action) {
  if (action.type === 'UPDATE_AUTHOR') {
    return {
      ...state,
      author: action.payload
    }
  }

  return state
}
```

Compare it with HoR style:

```typescript
import { compose, withActionType, withInitialState, mergeState, identity } from 'redux-hor'

export compose(
  onAction({ type: 'UPDATE_AUTHOR' }, merge({ author: action.payload }))
)(init(initialState))
```
